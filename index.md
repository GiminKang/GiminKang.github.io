## About
Hi, I'm Gimin Kang. I am a master student at the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE), Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), under Professor Woochang Kim.

In the past, I studied various machine learning models and how to utilize those models on various data, especially time-series. Recently, I want to conduct further research on how to apply machine learning techniques in practice, and help humans make the proper decisions through machine learning outcomes. Specifically, I want to study more about the following techniques.

- Data-Centric AI, which improves the performance of ML models by improving qualities of data.
- Decision Focused Learning, which can optimize quality of decisions during the training phase of models.

Through these research, I am eager to solve real world financial problems with machine learning skills.
